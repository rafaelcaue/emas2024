# Scope
A key unifying theme underlying Artificial Intelligence is the idea of intelligent software agents able to reason, act, interact, and learn. This metaphor has stimulated much research in AI and particularly in Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, giving rise to research in agent-oriented software engineering, programming multi-agent systems, and declarative agent languages and technologies.
